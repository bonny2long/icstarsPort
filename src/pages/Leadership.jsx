      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Team Week — Learning Each Other First</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Team Week was the first time our cohort came together not to write
        code, but to understand each other as people. We spent the week on
        structured walks, shared lunches, and small group activities where we
        heard each other&apos;s stories, backgrounds, and motivations. I
        learned that leadership starts with listening and that a strong team
        is built on relationships, not just tasks.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Gift Project — Ancestor&apos;s Dinner</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For the Gift Project, our team designed the Ancestor&apos;s Dinner — a
        potluck where everyone brought a dish from their heritage and shared
        the story behind it. I brought rice and beef stew, the kind of meal I
        grew up eating with my family while we shared stories around the
        table. Creating that space for culture, vulnerability, and connection
        reminded me that leadership is also about building environments where
        people feel seen.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        This project taught me how to plan and execute an event, but more than
        that, it showed me how powerful it is to intentionally create
        community inside a high-pressure program.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Planetary Responsibility — Defining My Impact</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Planetary Responsibility pushed me to think beyond myself. I started
        shaping my mission: to build technology that makes life easier, fairer,
        and more accessible, especially for communities that are often
        overlooked. It was the first time I clearly articulated the kind of
        world I want to help build and the responsibility that comes with
        technical skills.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Tea Hosts — Learning From Chicago&apos;s Leaders</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Each High Tea brought in leaders from across Chicago who shared their
        journeys, failures, and wisdom. Hosting and engaging in those
        conversations taught me how to ask better questions, how to listen with
        intention, and how to speak with presence.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Through their feedback and encouragement, I started to see a pattern:
        when I speak, people listen. That&apos;s a responsibility I carry
        forward as I grow in tech and leadership.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Dream Speech — Meeting My Future Self</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In my Dream Speech, I imagined myself in 2050 receiving a Tech Leader
        Award for building systems that make technology accessible and useful
        for small businesses and communities. I talked about my journey from
        entry-level developer to senior engineer, CTO, and co-founder of
        Métis, and the projects that made a difference along the way.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The core lesson from that speech came from Geek Week: when I stopped
        fearing failure, I realized I could build anything, including myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dream Speech wasn&apos;t just about the future. It was about
        deciding who I want to be today and aligning my actions with that
        version of myself.
